# severe bugs
* being able to crash lobbies

# decent bugs
* having infinite name length (have 4 bots with 80 char names and it fills the screen)
* bypasses name generator (namerator)

# minor bugs
* being able to create false lobbies (the lobby code is valid but nobody can join (stays open for like an hour im guessing))
* being able to change profiles mid-game
