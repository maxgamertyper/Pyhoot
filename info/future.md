# V1.2 (understood, needs tested):
* adds 2 auth bypass
* adds bot.crash_lobby()
* add bot.find_gamepin() (to test if that gamepin would be valid)

## important other things
* add to pip/pypi

## v1.3+ (ideas noted):
* add course support
* add an answer getter (would not work with random answers and questions)
* add other connection type support
* add team mode support
* add other game mode type support
* add an ability to host a game
