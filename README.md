## documentation (will improve later):

not relevant information at this moment i will probably add documentation.md on version V1.3.1
just look at base_example.py in the examples folder for now

## current V1.3 Plans:
* V1.3.1 will improve the documentation and the event listener outputs
* V1.3.2 will add the Host class allowing you to host a game (hopefully) or it will fix the auth bypass
* V1.3.3 will be whatever doesnt get added in V1.3.2
