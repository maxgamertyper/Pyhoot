# V1.1 (debugging):
* adds support for all question types
* adds bot.crash_lobby()

## V1.2 (understood, needs tested):
* adds 2 auth bypass

### v1.3+ (ideas noted):
* add course support
* add an answer getter (would not work with random answers and questions)
# add bot.find_gamepin() (to test if that gamepin would be valid)
